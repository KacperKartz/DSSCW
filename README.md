## Installation

Before you run the server, create a file called ``.env``, failure to do so correctly will cause the app to fail.
- Your ``.env`` file should follow the same variable names as what is found in ``.env.example``


Clone the repo

Run server

```bash
    cd .\Server
    nodemon server.js
```
